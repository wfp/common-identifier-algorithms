# Generic Hashing Implementation

This is the algorithm repository for a generic hashing implementation.
This is not a region dependent algorithm and is primarily used with the CI/CD tests


```toml
ðŸ“¦generic_hasher
 â”£ ðŸ“‚config         # contains the default configuration file and any UI styling overrides
 â”£ ðŸ“‚tests          # tests for the algorithm where necessary
 â”— ðŸ“œindex.ts       # main algorithm entrypoint, exporting a makeHasher function and REGION const
```
