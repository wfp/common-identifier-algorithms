# Generic Hashing Implementation

This is the algorithm repository for a generic hashing implementation.
This is not a region dependent algorithm and is primarily used with the CI/CD tests


```toml
📦generic_hasher
 ┣ 📂config         # contains the default configuration file and any UI styling overrides
 ┣ 📂tests          # tests for the algorithm where necessary
 ┗ 📜index.ts       # main algorithm entrypoint, exporting a makeHasher function and ALGORITHM_ID const
```
