# Generating configuration file signatures


Use the script `tools/config-signature.js` to generate a signature for a configuration file:

```
node tools/config-signature.js config.toml
Opening file:  config.toml
HASH: f3634ad11b145368af2ea19087921f5a
```

This signature can be copy-pasted into the `signature.config_signature` value in the config file (the signature is generated by ignoring the `signature` key)
